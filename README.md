# Final Project
 
Here are cheat codes to see some of the features (cheat codes work by typing in the code and hitting the run button, some code should appear, hit the stop program button then run it again)
 
- loopDemo (demonstrates combination of for loops and if statements)

- level1 (solution for level 1 of the game)

- level2 (solution for level 2 of the game, to pass this level, you need to run the program with the userIdentity variable set to "square" one time, then set to "circle" at least one time)

- level3 (hypothetical solution to level3 has I had time to create that level)

This is explained in the texts in the game, but to clear a level you must create a valid solution for it (as the game progresses, there would be more freedom in). To submit your code, go to file -> save. You should get a text from your boss saying you won (or lost if something went wrong), make sure to open that text. To progress to the next level go to "Hello, azhai" -> log out. A cutscene should playing featuring an exchange between two characters. As the game goes on, my plan is to make the characters become more suspicious of the company the player works for, some endings of the game would result in them exposing the companies practices (perhaps even with the player's help), some endings they are won over and remain complacent.

I also encourage everyone to try writing programs of their own and testing the limits of the editor (I'm sure you'll end up exposing some flaws in the interpreter). I'd be super curious to see code that I didn't write running in the editor, so feel free to send me screenshots!
